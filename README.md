Social Media Mobile Application for short form written content

## Prerequisites

Development and testing was conducted using a Windows computer and an Android mobile phone, iOS performance/compatibility is not _guaranteed_, but it should be fine due to the lack of OS native functionality in this application.

You need to install Node(^v18.0), the Java Development Kit (JDK) and Android Studio to use an android emulator.

Follow **ALL** these instructions for the best results: [React Native | Setup Environment](https://reactnative.dev/docs/set-up-your-environment)

## How to run

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/f-okd/react-native-demo
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory on your local machine:

   ```bash
   cd C:\...\react-native-demo
   ```

3. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. Rename .env.example to .env or .env.local and populate the environment variables with your own credentials

5. Start the app

   ```bash
    npm start
   ```

6. Press 'a' key to open using android emulator, or scan the QR code on the Expo Go app (Android)
   - If you're using Expo-Go like I am, make sure your mobile device and PC are on the same network.

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo
